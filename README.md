ngSoundcloud
===
An angular SoundCloud element. Just pop an ( ng-soundcloud track="yourtrack" ) element and you're done. Modular and easy to style to your liking. 

Not stable at the moment, I'm changing variable names and organizing like crazy, but feel free to mess with it anyways if you know what you're doing. 

Dependencies
===
 - AngularJS 1.2.20 or higher
 - IonIcons 1.5.2 or higher

Goals
===
 - output JSON to scope instead of mapping variables.
 - addition of time controller like video.js or youtube.
 - more interesting default design, transitions, coolbeans.
 - addition of more API elements, such as playlists, profiles, comments.
